% Review Session in Clapp108 on Sunday 12/17 from 2pm-4pm. 
% Review packet to be handed out
% Final exam will be hekd in Allen Autorium in Ford
%   12/19 from 3:30pm to 6:30pm

%% Lecture Practice 1 - Logical Indexing
clc;
clear;
close all;

% create initial buggy year vector. It contains the yearss 1950-2016, but
% from 2000 onwards, the computer had an error to report 2000 as 1900, 2001
% as 1901, and so on.
year = [1950:1:1999, 1900:1:1916];

% use logical indexing to sort out the buggy years
good_years = year(year>=1950);

% use logical indexing to make a buggy vector
bug_years = year(year<=1916);

% correct the list
corrected_list = [good_years, bug_years+100];

%% Lecture Practice 2 - Curve Fitting
clc;
clear;
close all;

% create test data
v_meas = 1:20;
F_meas = v_meas.^2;

% F = Apv^2
% polyfit generates coefs, polyval evaluates the x
fit_coef = polyfit(v_meas, F_meas, 2);
F_fit = polyval(fit_coef, v_meas);

% plot the original and fitted data on the same graph with labels
plot(v_meas, F_meas, '.b'); hold on
plot(v_meas, F_fit, '--r'); hold off

%% Lecture Practice 3 - Files and Strings
clc;
