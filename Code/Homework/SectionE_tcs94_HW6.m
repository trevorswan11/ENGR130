%% Problem 1 - MATLAB Grader

% housekeeping commands would go here, but we leave them out to keep Grader happy

%bring in data from data file - it is random here to simulate some data
%vector that is provided. It is not known what values will be in the vector
%nor how many values it will contain, so the length is random as well.
A = randi([1,100],1,500);

%in one line, find how many elements of vector A are equal to 4
Num_of_4s = numel(A(A==4));

%in one line, find how many elements of vector A are divisible by 5
Div_by_5 = numel(A(mod(A,5)==0));

%in one line, sum all of the elements of the vector A that are greater than
%50.
Sum_Over_50 = sum(A(A>50));

%in one line, find the mean value of all elements of the vector A that are
%less than 30.
Mean_Under_30 = mean(A(A<30));

%in one line, find how many elements are equal to the maximum value in the
%vector A
Number_at_Max = numel(A(A==max(A)));

%in one line, create a new vector with all the even-valued elements in A
B = A(mod(A,2)==0 & A~=0);
