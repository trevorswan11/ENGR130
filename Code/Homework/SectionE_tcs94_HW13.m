%% Problem 1 - MATLAB Grader
clc;
clear;
close all; 

% bring in data from file and reorganize it into two vectors
% call the new vector of floating point numbers float_vec
% call the new vector of integers int_vec
% note that you will need more lines than the number of blank lines
%   that the file starts with
% use a file ID of in_data because it will keep MATLAB
%    grader happy
in_data = fopen("UnknownNumbers.txt", 'r');
for idx = 1:20 
    float_vec(idx) = fscanf(in_data, '%f', 1);

% find the number of elements in each new vector.
% call the number of floating point elements num_float.
% call the number of integer elements num_int.
num_float = numel(float_vec);
num_int = numel(int_vec);
